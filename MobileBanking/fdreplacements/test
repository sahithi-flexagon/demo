# To get started type 'replacement-' and select the template you want to use.
# YAML uses backslash as its escape character and eats the first layer of quote marks.
# Use Double Quotes around values containing '$', '*', or '{'.

# To reference a FlexDeploy property, use the property name directly. No need to prefix with $. Example FD_ENVIRONMENT_CODE.

# Sample replacement
# ---
# fileName: "*.txt"
# replacements:
#  - stringToReplace: "my static string"
#    replaceWithString: "my replaced string"
#    replaceWhenEnv:
#      - env: "FD_ENVIRONMENT_CODE"
#        value: "DEV"
replacements:
  - stringToReplace: "var"
    replaceWithString: "variable_withSCM"
